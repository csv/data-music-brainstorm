Hi! Who told me about this guy? Was it you? If not, I will tell you about
him!

He does some sort of stuff including "Computational Music Analysis" - I'm
less sure about the other direction. Possibly cool?

I won't make it to csv this week - keep on rockin' - and let me know if you
hear anything further about Transparency Camp! Best,

- Aaron
