Just came across "Listen to Wikipedia" -- an audio/visual representation of
wiki updates. Made me think of OaklandWiki, though maybe this only becomes
interesting at a certain scale/frequency of updates ...

In any case, might be fun to integrate with the "Recent Changes" page, or
other projects that are updated frequently.
